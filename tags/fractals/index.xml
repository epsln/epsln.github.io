      <description>In the past article we&amp;rsquo;ve seen an overview of what kind of objects we were talking about, and how to create generators that would be interesting to explore. In this part, we&amp;rsquo;ll talk about the bread and butter of Indra&amp;rsquo;s Pearl, namely the Depth First Exploration Algorithm, or DFS. For the sake of simplicity, i&amp;rsquo;ll refer to the inverse of a generator using the uppercase version of it&amp;rsquo;s associated letter, so the inverse of a is A, and the inverse of b is B.</description>

      <description>This post is a part of a series where I try to explain my work on implementing methods from the book &amp;ldquo;Indra&amp;rsquo;s Pearl&amp;rdquo;, from Mumford, Series and Wright. In the first part I talked about the very basics. If you haven&amp;rsquo;t read it, I&amp;rsquo;d recommend it, simply because I really like it, and also because you might not understand what I&amp;rsquo;m talking about.
In this post we&amp;rsquo;ll talk about how we chose the specific MÃ¶bius Transform that we&amp;rsquo;ll use for our exploration.</description>

      <description>A few months back I started reading Indra&amp;rsquo;s Pearl by Mumford, Series and Wright. The book is amazing, and I&amp;rsquo;m not scared to say it&amp;rsquo;s one of my favorite books about Maths that I&amp;rsquo;ve ever read. I wanted to get my hands dirty and implement some of the fractals in the book, since they were very different from the usual &amp;ldquo;Mandelbrot and cousins&amp;rdquo; fractals: they were truly out of this world.</description>
