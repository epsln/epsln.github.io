      <description>A few months back I started reading Indra&amp;rsquo;s Pearl by Mumford, Series and Wright. The book is amazing, and I&amp;rsquo;m not scared to say it&amp;rsquo;s one of my favorite books about Maths that I&amp;rsquo;ve ever read. I wanted to get my hands dirty and implement some of the fractals in the book, since they were very different from the usual &amp;ldquo;Mandelbrot and cousins&amp;rdquo; fractals: they were truly out of this world.</description>
