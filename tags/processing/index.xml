      <description>This post is the first part of an attempt at explaining most of the small animations I have done in the past few years.
The Ullam Spiral is fairly straight forward: by arranging the integers in a spiral, and only marking the primes, you obtain strange, and frankly cool looking patterns.
Creating this sort of image is very simple. I simply created a basic loop that construct the spiral, which follows the following pattern: ULDDRRRUUUULLLL&amp;hellip;, assigning an integer to each step and checking if it was prime.</description>
