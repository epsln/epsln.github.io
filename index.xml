      <description>Keeping up with the traditions I&amp;rsquo;ve set-up a few days ago, we&amp;rsquo;re going to talk about chaos. &amp;ldquo;Oh no, yet another boring example of a Henon map ? Maybe with colors this time ? Or just the Lorentz Attractor with some platitudes on the chaos in life itself ?&amp;rdquo;, you may say, snarkily. Well, voices in my head, no, not quite.
I kinda dig logic as a field. And by &amp;ldquo;dig&amp;rdquo;, I mean looking from afar and vaguely nodding when someones talks to me about consistency of a formal system.</description>

      <description>One of the things I try a lot is to make cool looking images with the least effort on my part. The easiest way to do that is to let the computer do my work. At least, that&amp;rsquo;s the theory; in practice I spend a lot of time tweaking the various functions and tidbits that make the final product. Maybe some day I&amp;rsquo;ll just paint the individual pixel myself, it&amp;rsquo;ll probably be a bit less trouble.</description>

      <description>This time we&amp;rsquo;re gonna talk about things I know a little bit more about : bifurcation diagrams and iterated functions. The code is available here
Bifurcation diagrams show the behavior of a function \( f: \mathbb{R} \rightarrow \mathbb{R} \), with a real parameter under iteration. Iteration simply means &amp;ldquo;plugging the output into the input&amp;rdquo;: a feedback if you will. Iterating from a &amp;ldquo;seed&amp;rdquo; \(p\), the function can converge to a value (i.</description>

      <description>On this second episode of &amp;ldquo;what has Epsilon done for the past years&amp;rdquo;, we&amp;rsquo;re gonna talk about&amp;hellip; Prime Numbers. Code is available here.
The primes does have this capacity to create some interesting looking things, I&amp;rsquo;ll give them that. The Gaussian integers are simply complex numbers whose real and imaginary part are integers, and whose modulus is prime. If one component of this number p is 0, then p is prime only if the other component is prime and p % 4 = 3.</description>

      <title>Ulam Spiral</title>

      <description>This post is the first part of an attempt at explaining most of the small animations I have done in the past few years.
The Ulam Spiral is fairly straight forward: by arranging the integers in a spiral, and only marking the primes, you obtain strange, and frankly cool looking patterns.
Creating this sort of image is very simple. I simply created a basic loop that construct the spiral, which follows the following pattern: ULDDRRRUUUULLLL&amp;hellip;, assigning an integer to each step and checking if it was prime.</description>

      <description>Hi. I&amp;rsquo;m Epsilon, and this is a blog.
I&amp;rsquo;m a Computer Engineer, specialised in Machine Learning and Computer Vision. Most of my research works centers around automated detection in Archaeology. I have introduced the use of YOLO in LiDAR detection for this purpose, in a research internship at the University of Leiden. I have also worked in rare event detection in train borne systems at the SNCF. I am currently available for hire.</description>
