      <description>This post is the first part of an attempt at explaining most of the small animations I have done in the past few years.
The Ullam Spiral is fairly straight forward: by arranging the integers in a spiral, and only marking the primes, you obtain strange, and frankly cool looking patterns.
Creating this sort of image is very simple. I simply created a basic loop that construct the spiral, which follows the following pattern: ULDDRRRUUUULLLL&amp;hellip;, assigning an integer to each step and checking if it was prime.</description>

      <description>Hi. I&amp;rsquo;m Epsilon, and this is a blog.
I&amp;rsquo;m a Computer Engineer, specialised in Machine Learning and Computer Vision. Most of my research works centers around automated detection in Archaeology. I have introduced the use of YOLO in LiDAR detection for this purpose, in a research internship at the University of Leiden. I have also worked in rare event detection in train borne systems at the SNCF. I am currently available for hire.</description>
